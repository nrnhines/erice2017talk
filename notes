They are finalizing the program for the 2017 Golgi School of  
Brain Cells and Circuit at Erice, Nov.29-Dec.03.
Would you be able to give a talk with an introduction on NEURON and  
bottom up models, including an introduction on parallelization with  
NEURON/coreNeuron?

Bottom-up brain modeling: the NEURON platform
45 minutes

modeling involves a language with elements that combine.
Cell
Channel
connection

What is NEURON for.
What does it look like.
How does it work
Conceptual vs Representation
Want small change in concept to result in small change in representation.
Essence vs accident.
  Separate computer specific issues (discretization, numerical issues,
  accuracy, performance) from description.
Description vs recipe vs (elements + composition procedures)
Need to focus, isolate, exeriment.

Cell description satisfyingly maps concepts to representation.
Cell, synapse, channel, ions, reactions, diffusion, voltage, current.
Network description not as settled.
 From NEURON perspective, source to target connections
